# DSA---LeetCode
Collection of my LeetCode DSA solutions in Java — organized, clean, and updated daily.

Welcome to my coding space where I solve LeetCode problems to strengthen my concepts, improve my problem-solving abilities, and sharpen my debugging skills. 
This repo is a growing collection of my DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) solutions written in **Java**.

I’m solving problems consistently — sometimes for practice, sometimes for curiosity, and sometimes because a bug challenged my ego!!!

## What you'll find here
- Clean and readable Java solutions  
- Logic explained inside comments(very detailed)
- Easy → Medium problems (Hard soon... maybe 👀)  
- Topics like:
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  - HashMap
  - Two Pointers
  - Stack, Queue
  - Binary Search
  - …and whatever I feel like solving next ✨

## Goal of this repo
Not to be perfect —
but to **learn**, **experiment**, **fail fast**, and **come back smarter**.

I treat this repo as:
✔ A study notebook  
✔ A progress tracker  
✔ A fun place where I break problems until they break me 😆  
✔ A resource someone else might benefit from

## 🛠 Language Used
- **Java**(my go-to for DSA)
